16 September 2015Minister of Communications, Ms Faith Muthambi will unveil the SABC s new multi-purpose studio full HD on Wednesday 16th, September, 2015. The studio will service SABC Sport and SABC News respectively, using the latest technology equipment and features. This new studio and its top of the range specifications enable the SABC to be more ready for Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT). The studio is been built in such a way that it will be easy to adapt to the variations that DTT comes with in terms of broadcasting. The unveiling of the SABC new high tech studio comes just days before the official opening of the International Rugby World Cup 2015. The studio and set will be utilized for the first time during the Rugby World Cup 2015, which kicks off on Friday, as well as key events such as the Local Municipal Elections and the 2016 Olympic Games. I must commend the SABC leadership for ensuring that majority of our people will have an access and opportunity to watch Amabokoboko during International Rugby World 2015. The SABC will broadcast 37 International Rugby World Cup matches throughout September .
