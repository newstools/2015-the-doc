4 November 2015Minister of Communications Ms Faith Muthambi takes the broadcasting digital migration public awareness campaign to the community of Rustenburg in Northwest on the 7th of November, 2015. The Minister will be accompanied by the Premier of the North West Supra Mahumapelo. The Department of Communications has been hard at work this year criss-crossing provinces and making presentations to stakeholders from the SA Local Government Authority as well as Provincial Government members about digital migration and its state of readiness. Provinces have been receptive to the Broadcasting Migration public awareness campaigns," said Muthambi. Furthermore, the minister is in consultation with her colleagues at the Department of Trade and Industry to find out how government can contribute towards building a sustainable electronic manufacturing sector beyond just manufacturing set-top boxes. Equally exciting is the fact that digital migration does not only affect television services. Government is committed to ensuring that all economic opportunities resulting from this project are explored and fully exploited to the benefit of South Africans, especially young people. Electronic manufacturers and producers of broadcasting content are just some of the sectors that stand to benefit," added Muthambi.Details for the event: Venue: Ben Marais Hall, Rustenburg, North West Date: Saturday, 7 November 2015 Time: 10:00am Enquiries: Mish Molakeng on Cell: 082 469 3997Issued by Ministry of Communications
