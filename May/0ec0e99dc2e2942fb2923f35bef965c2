18 May 2015Deputy Minister of Communications, Ms Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams (MP) intensifies her campaign of making IT fashionable to rural schools. On Friday, 22 May 2015, she will be at Ngangolwandle High School, in Elliotdale, Mbhashe Local Municipality, Amathole District to handover Information and Communication Technologies as part of Africa Month and Child Protection Week.This is in line with the National Broadband Policy of 2013 that seeks to ensure that South Africa connects by creating opportunities and ensuring inclusion in schools, health facilities and public sector facilities. In terms of this policy, all schools should have access to broadband at a speed of 10 Megabytes per second by 2020.This unique partnership initiative has been made possible through collaborative efforts between Government with Landbank donating 25 desk top computers and Vodacom donating a Mindset Learn Broadcasting Appliance and tele/fax modem to the value of R97 452.45 as a contribution to improve teaching and learning in the previously disadvantaged schools. MEC for Rural Development and Agrarian Reform will also donate seedlings and agricultural starter pack for the school. Eastern Cape AIDS Council will also support the school in dealing with various social ills faced by learners working with Soul City and Lovelife. In this event Health related services will be provided for the benefit of the community.Members of the media are invited and encouraged to attend.Details are as follows:Date: 22 May 2015 Time: 10h00 Venue: Ngangolwandle High School, Lombola Village, Ward 17, Elliotdale (Xhorha), Eastern CapeRSVP: Yolisa Blom Cell: 071 641 5077 (GCIS EC)Tabita Ngqunge Cell: 072 344 7712 (GCIS EC)Enquiries: Zolisa Xabadiya Cell: 083 624 7785 (Ministry) Ndlelantle Pinyana Cell: 076 142 8606 (GCIS EC)Issued by: Department of Communications
