Acting CEO for Brand South Africa Ms. Alice Puoane said: When young people can claim their right to health, education and decent working conditions, they become a powerful force for economic development and positive change. South Africa, like many other countries in Africa, has a growing population of young people and, we at Brand South Africa believe that the energy of the youth can be harnessed to build the economy. It is therefore unquestionable that, young people deserve a bigger share of development investments.
