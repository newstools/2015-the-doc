10 June 2015The Deputy Minister of Communications, Hon. Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams will give a keynote address at the launch and live screening of the premiere episode of a youth television talk show called Before Forever After on Soweto TV (DStv Channel 251), based on Pastor Dick Koza s latest book, Before we marry let s talk .The show will be anchored by Mr Nimrod Nkosi and aims to get couples who are intending to marry, to talk about those burning issues which ought to be discussed prior to marriage. Before Forever After provides an opportune time to launch a show based on family values and moral regeneration, social cohesion and rebuilding of families.Linked to the show is the Mxit mobile application, Marriage Talk which was expressly created by the television show s executive producer as a platform to engage with a younger audience; as well as those in rural and underserviced areas who may not have access to DStv. The initiative is valuable as it is there to broaden community media to meet the needs of the broader communities.Recently at the DoC Budget Vote speech, the Deputy Minister lauded Soweto TV s role in playing their part in media transformation. In the same breadth we note the sterling work executed by Soweto TV which currently attracts over 3, 1 million viewers and employs over 100 people, of which 80% of are local young people , said Ndabeni- Abrahams. Details of the launch are as follows: Date: Wednesday, 10 June 2015 Time: 18h30 for 19h00 Venue: Grace Bible Church, 1478 Dlebelendlovu Street, Pimville, Soweto.
