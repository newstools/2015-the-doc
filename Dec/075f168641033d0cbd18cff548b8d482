2 December 2015 Minister of Communications Ms Faith Muthambi will attend the International Development Cooperation meeting on Gender and Media from the 7th to 10th December 2015 in Geneva, Switzerland. The Minister will also give an opening statement and chair panel discussions on issues of gender and media at the conference. The International Development Cooperation Meeting on Gender and Media will give impetus to all stakeholders to work together to achieve gender equality and empowerment of women in and through media, including online platforms.According to the 2011 ITU and UNESCO-led Broadband Commission Report, there are 200 million less women on the Internet than men. The percentage is even more worrying in regions such as Africa and Asia. While our country has done a lot on gender equality and representation of women in the media, more can still be done in an effort to create social balance, said Muthambi.South Africa participated in The United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, and signed the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action the same year and committed to undertake a comprehensive national review of the progress made and challenges encountered in implementing the Platform of Action for the achievement of gender equality and empowerment of Women. Women empowerment is critical for NDP implementation . Added Muthambi. For enquiries: Mish Molakeng Cell: 082 469 3997Issued by Ministry of Communications
